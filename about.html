<p class="rightinfo">Co-founder of <a href="http://hugecity.us">hugecity.us</a> & software developer in Atlanta, GA.  I mostly do Ruby on Rails (because it's cleaner, faster, and makes me say "I can't believe that worked on the first try" constantly) and Javascript (all hail jQuery), but have oodles of experience in the web & enterprise Java realms.  In a past life, I did Java development for the <a href="http://cdc.gov">CDC</a>, working on various <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/phin/">PHIN</a> tools.  Notably, I created the PHIN Exchange system for use by the CDC and state health departments to pass health alerting messages.  In a past, past life, I did mission control software prototyping for <a href="http://nasa.gov">NASA</a> while in grad school at <a href="http://gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>.</p>
