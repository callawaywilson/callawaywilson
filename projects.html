	<h3>HugeCity.us</h3>
	<p><a href="http://hugecity.us">HugeCity.us</a> is a site I'm working on with <a href="mailto:huge@hugecity.us">Hugh Malkin</a> and <a href="mailto:ed@hugecity.us">Edward Kujawski</a>.  It's an events/deals site that lays out everything in Atlanta on a big google map. We source events from various places and link with your facebook account to make sure we show you the events that you want to see.  We're working on a mobile app to get people aware of the events going on in their area quickly and easily.  The site is implemented in MySQL/Redis/RoR/jQuery.  There's a prototype of the mobile app running implemented in Sencha Touch (just visit the site on an iPhone or Android device).</p>

	<h3>Social Counts</h3>
	<p><a href="http://counts.callawaywilson.com">Social Counts</a> share counter is a quick web utility and REST web service to count the number of times a link has been "socially shared" on the internet.  I implemented it in a couple of nights, but I'd like to expand it to do a bit more, like counting twitter hash tags, products, scan codes, and other kinds of resources.  The entry points are the web page, a RESTful JSON web service and a RESTful XML service.</p>

	<h3>jQuery pMVC</h3>
	<p>PMVC = Progressive Model View Controller.  Basically the idea is to turn any div and javascript hash into a model and view.  There's lots of toolkits that do things similar to this, but they're all huge and pretty much force you to use custom widgets or their own UI framework.  I'd like to be able to work with my view in plain html with minimal shims between my model and the html that's output.  The div class is assigned a render/destroy method and the object to display.  The template can be existing html on the page or a custom template like mustache.js.  The libary just simplifies the bookkeeping so you don't have to repeat yourself.</p>
