	<h3>HugeCity.us</h3>
	<p><a href="http://hugecity.us">HugeCity.us</a> is a site I'm working on with <a href="mailto:huge@hugecity.us">Hugh Malkin</a>.  It integrates with your facebook account to feed you events that you and your friends are interested in.  It'll show you what's going on, who's going and what your friends are doing based on your facebook data.  We're working on a mobile app right now.</p>

	<h3>EmailBack.us</h3>
	<p><a href="http://emailback.us">EmailBack.us</a>  Real simple web form processing.  A super-simple to use pipe for your web forms to be sent to your email.  Perfect for when that contact form is the only thing preventing you from having a completely static site, don't want to buy wordpress plugins, or just need to test something right now.</p>

	<h3>Social Counts</h3>
	<p><a href="http://counts.callawaywilson.com">Social Counts</a> share counter is a quick web utility and REST web service to count the number of times a link has been "socially shared" on the internet.  I implemented it in a couple of nights, but I'd like to expand it to do a bit more, like counting twitter hash tags, products, scan codes, and other kinds of resources.  The entry points are the web page, a RESTful JSON web service and a RESTful XML service.</p>
