    <h2 class="media-heading">The Peekr</h2>
    <p><a href="http://thepeekr.com">The Peekr</a> is a tool I built to get overview metadata from web sites.  It fetches a page and parses out and makes sense of all the metadata on it to get the title, description, canonical url, image, keywords, and any associated data about it.  I also built a fun little JS mouse-over preview library to use it on a web page.</p>

    <h2 class="media-heading">HugeCity.us</h2>
    <p><a href="http://hugecity.us">HugeCity.us</a> was a site and app I built with <a href="mailto:huge@hugecity.us">Hugh Malkin</a>.  It was acquired by Time Out in 2014.  It integrated with your facebook account to feed you events that you and your friends are interested in.  It showed you what's going on, who's going and what your friends are doing based on your Facebook data. <small><em>Photo: Eide Magazine</em></small></p>

    <h2 class="media-heading">EmailBack.us (inactive)</h2>
    <p><a href="http://emailback.us">EmailBack.us</a>  Real simple web form processing.  A super-simple to use pipe for your web forms to be sent to your email.  Perfect for when that contact form is the only thing preventing you from having a completely static site, don't want to buy wordpress plugins, or just need to test something right now.</p>
